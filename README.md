# 🚲 Bike Rental Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses a linear regression model to predict bike rental counts based on weather-related features. It also includes evaluation metrics and an analysis of how each feature impacts the prediction.

## 📁 Dataset

Uses the `day.csv` dataset (commonly from the UCI Bike Sharing Dataset), which contains daily records of bike rentals along with weather and seasonal information.

### Example Features:
- **temp**: Normalized temperature in Celsius
- **windspeed**: Normalized wind speed
- **season**: Categorical (spring, summer, fall, winter)
- **cnt**: Total count of bike rentals (our target)
